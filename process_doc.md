Hi! I just started working on this project officially a couple days ago, but I've been thinking of the idea for months now. I work part time as a barista at our student-run bubble tea cafe at Pomona College called Milk and Honey. We only open for **2.5 hours twice a week**, and we're usually pretty busy during our opening hours. Because it's hard to remake ingredients during our open hours, we prep tons of boba and teas beforehand (we have a very scuffed setup).

### The problem: Because we have to guess how much of each ingredient we need to make at the start of the shift, we often make too much or not enough of each ingredient, causing a lot of waste and possible lost profits.

I created a mySQL instance on Google Cloud and I'm creating the tables, cleaning the data, and reformatting using Pandas Dataframes. I'm hoping to clean and aggregate the order data from the past 2 years and create a table for days (to track weather), weeks, and semesters by the time I'm done working today.
