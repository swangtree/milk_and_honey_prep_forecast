Hi! I just started working on this project officially a couple days ago, but I've been thinking of the idea for months now. I work part time as a barista at our student-run bubble tea cafe at Pomona College called Milk and Honey. We only open for **2.5 hours twice a week**, and we're usually pretty busy during our opening hours. Because it's hard to remake ingredients during our open hours, we prep tons of boba and teas beforehand (we have a very scuffed setup).

### The problem: Because we have to guess how much of each ingredient we need to make at the start of the shift
